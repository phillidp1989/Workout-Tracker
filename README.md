## Description:
Workout tracker which allows the user to add workouts and associated exercises to their personal dashboard. The dashboard shows four charts, providing a visualisation of the total duration exercised, weight lifted and exercises performed in their last 7 workouts. The project utilises node.js, Express, and MongoDB, with the ORM Mongoose being used to query the database. The front-end code was provided by Trilogy.
